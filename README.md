# Alpha Cycle Sleep Calculator

## Description

The **Alpha Cycle Sleep Calculator** is a simple, web-based tool designed to help users plan their sleep schedule around natural sleep cycles. By aligning with 90-minute sleep cycles, this calculator assists users in choosing optimal times to go to bed or wake up, ensuring a more restful and rejuvenating sleep experience. This tool is ideal for anyone looking to improve their sleep quality by timing their sleep in sync with natural cycles, allowing them to wake up at the end of a sleep cycle and feel more refreshed.

## Features

- **Optimal Wake-up Time Calculator**: Enter your planned bedtime, and the calculator provides several ideal wake-up times to choose from.
- **Ideal Bedtime Calculator**: If you know when you need to wake up, the calculator suggests optimal times to go to bed.
- **Adjustable Sleep Preparation Time**: Customize how long it typically takes you to fall asleep (default is 15 minutes).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean, Easy-to-use Interface**: Designed for simplicity, the interface is intuitive and straightforward, suitable for users of all ages.

## How It Works

Sleep cycles typically last around 90 minutes, during which the body moves through various stages of light and deep sleep. The Alpha Cycle Sleep Calculator helps users time their sleep by providing wake-up or bedtime suggestions in multiples of 90-minute cycles. This way, users can wake up at the end of a sleep cycle rather than in the middle of one, minimizing grogginess.

For example, if a user goes to bed at 10:00 PM, the calculator might suggest wake-up times of 11:30 PM, 1:00 AM, 2:30 AM, and so on, up to 7 cycles (approximately 10.5 hours of sleep).
